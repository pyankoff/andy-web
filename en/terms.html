          <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By accessing or using the App, you (“you”) confirm that you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. You also confirm that you are either at least 18 years old or, if you are younger than 18, that you have the permission of your parent or legal guardian, who will take responsibility for your compliance with these Terms of Service. </p>
          <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Terms of Service may be updated from time to time by Andy English Bot.  You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time here:&nbsp;www.andychatbot.com/en/terms. Your continued use of the Service or the Site after any such changes have been made constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. </p>
          <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not agree to comply with these or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Service or the Site. </p>
          <p><strong>II. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE </strong></p>
          <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new feature that is added to the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. </p>
          <p><strong>III.  FEES </strong></p>
          <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic version of the Service can be used completely free of charge. However, you have the option to subscribe to a Premium membership in order to get access to additional learning functionalities (such as grammar material, vocabulary practice, etc.) on the App.&nbsp; </p>
          <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prices and the related terms for all Paid Services, including the Premium membership, are governed by the Paid Services terms set out in clause 4 below. </p>
          <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a free trial period is included, you will not be charged until the free period is over. At this point your card will automatically be charged using the card details entered at the beginning of the trial. There are no refunds or credits for partial monthly subscriptions. </p>
          <p><strong>IV.  PAID SERVICES  </strong></p>
          <p> Where you have purchased a Paid Service (including a Premium membership), details of which can be found within the App the following terms set out in this clause 4 shall also apply to your use and access of the Paid Service.  Where there is any conflict between this clause 4 and the other terms set out in these Terms of Service, the terms in this clause 4 will prevail.  The following terms shall apply to you whether or not you are the individual using the Paid Service or if you are a third party facilitating and/or paying on behalf of an individual (such as a student, employee, agent, contractor or other representative) to use the Paid Service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing if you are using the Paid Service pursuant to an agreement entered into by Andy English Bot and a third party paying for and/or facilitating your use of the Paid Service then where the terms below are in conflict with the terms of the agreement entered into by Andy English Bot and the third party the terms of such agreement shall prevail. </p>
          <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordering process for Paid Services on the App allows you to check your order before you proceed with your purchase: please check the details of the order before you proceed to payment. The contract between you and Andy English Bot for the relevant Paid Service, which is subject to these Paid Services Terms, is formed at the time we send such confirmation email. </p>
          <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By placing an order, you agree to pay the stipulated fees (which may be separately agreed with Andy English Bot) for the relevant Paid Service(s) by credit card or any other form of payment accepted by Andy English Bot, along with the VAT (if applicable) and any other fees or amounts associated with such Paid Service(s). The most recent fees for each Paid Service are set out within the App and you acknowledge and agree that such fees may change from time to time. Any price changes will be announced on the Andy English Bot website and will not affect existing subscriptions (so if you have signed up for a membership for a certain price, price changes won’t affect your existing subscription, and will only apply to any future subscription purchase). </p>
          <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy English Bot uses secure payment service providers to make sure that your payments are secure. </p>
          <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to Paid Services that are offered on a subscription basis, Andy English Bot offers different subscription periods so that you can choose the one that best meets your needs. Payment for subscription-based Paid Services is made in advance. Details of the different subscription types and prices are available within the App. </p>
          <p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a subscription-based Paid Service renews automatically, your credit card will be charged automatically at the end of your current subscription period and your subscription will, unless you cancel it, be renewed for the same period of time. Subscriptions do not expire during the subscription period due to non-use of the subscribed Paid Service. You can check on the length of your subscription at any time by viewing your account information or going to "Settings" and then “Subscription” within the Site. </p>
          <p> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy English Bot may run promotions and free offers which may be subject to additional terms or restrictions. These promotions and offers may not be shared among different Users. </p>
