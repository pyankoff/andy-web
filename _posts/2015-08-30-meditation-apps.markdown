<p>There are lots of meditation apps on App Store. Some for beginners, others for experienced meditators. All of them are different, have different functions, design, purpose. Some of them offer guided meditations, some try to build community, others just simple timers.</p>

<p>And that is great. One size fits all is never a great approach. Diversity powers evolution. Every meditation application builds on features of others and does some things better, simplier in a more elegant way.</p>

<p>Einstein said: <em>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</em> It is one of the main principles behind our meditation timer and we believe it's the future.</p>
