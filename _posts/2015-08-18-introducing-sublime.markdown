<p>I've started meditating a couple of month ago. One of the first things I did after reading my first book on meditation was opening App Store and looking for a timer. I wanted something simple and well-designed.</p>

<p>Meditation timer is a very simple app. It's just a clock with some gentle sound when the time is up and maybe a couple of interval sounds along the way. I was very surprised when I couldn't find any free app that would perform such a simple functions.</p>

<p>So I've decided to make one. At the moment it goes through Apple approval process and should be available next week. Stay tuned!</p>
